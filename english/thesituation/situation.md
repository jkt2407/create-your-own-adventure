You suddenly realize that you have not thought of how you got here or where you came from or even who you are.
This situation really must be addressed...

So you stop and contemplate these existential questions. "How did I get here?" you ask yourself, but you
can't seem to remember a time before the marshmallows. "Where did I come from?" you wonder aloud. Nothing.
Not even a whisper. The past is opaque.

The hairs on the back of your neck begin to rise and an overwhelming feeling of dread engulfs you like a
velvet fog. You panic, and cry out, "Who the hell am I? Mel Torme?"

What do you do next?
